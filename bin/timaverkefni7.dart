  // The best way to solve a complex problem is to break it into smaller problems.
  // Functions allow us to break a complicated algorithm into smaller ones.
  // You have already been using functions so far, the void main(List<String> arguments) {} is a function.
  // That is your main function, the program itself. But you can create other functions outside of the main one.
  // And call for them to use inside your main one. Keeps your main function cleaner and simpler.

  // Built in functions you are already familiar with. everytime you use .something you are using a built in function.
  // item.length and item.toUpperCase are samples of them.
  // The ones you create yourself are called User-defined functions.
